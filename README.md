#Parel
->Creates a dev build for us
->Creates a local server for us
->It hosts our app on server  
->It does HMR or hot reloading as well (Hot Module Replacement)- when we make code changes parcel will automatically update code in the browser
->Parcel uses a file-watching algorithm and is written in C++
->Gives us faster builds because of caching
->parcel-cache file is created where it does caching(stores things)
->It will also do image optimization
-> When we do a production build parcel will minify all our files
->Bundles the files
->will also compress the files
->It does consistent hashing
->Code splitting
->Differential bundling: it means support of older version browsers
->diagnostic things
->Gives us better error suggestions - Better error handling
->It also gives us a way to host the app on HTTPS
->Tree shaking, supposer we have 100s of functions in our code and we are using few of them then the parcel will remove unused code for us it will tree shake our file
->Different dev and production bundles because production build takes a little bit of time than build for dev some optimizations are more on production and less on dev build
